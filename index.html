      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a UCF graduate with years of experience in the professional client services industry. Recently, I have decided to begin my programming journey and transition into this exciting new field.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally from Madison, Wisconsin, I have spent the last 20 years growing-up in Florida. However, after an amazing opportunity to move to the Pacific North West, I now find myself in Oregon.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Hobbies have come and gone throughout the years, but what has stuck around most are video-gaming (team XBOX, wooo!) and working out. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>This has also changed as I have gotten older, but at this time it is my goal to become a professional Website Developer or Software Engineer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Salem, Oregon</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Honestly, because it is evident that this career choice (and the industry overall) is here to stay and is essentially "future proof". This career choice is also something that I feel I can truly break into and excel at so long as I put in the work to really understand it. Plus, I hear the monetary rewards are very rewarding ;)</p>
